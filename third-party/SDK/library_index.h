//! \since 2.0
//! Provides access to indexed searches of media library content, \n
//! which in typical scenarios are much faster than running whole library content via search filters. \n
//! Not every search query is supported by library index - in particular, queries relying on title formatting cannot be optimized. \n
//! In such cases, search() will fall through to legacy search filter use. \n
//! Note that if your query looks like: cond1 AND cond2 AND cond3 (...), and only some of the conditions cannot be searched using index, \n
//! search() will use the supported subset of your query to only feed relevant subset of your library to slow search filters.
