After cloning:
1. Set the paulstretch project as the startup project.
2. Install portable copies of foobar2000 (32 and 64 bit) in their respective folders. I've left empty ones in the repository to illustrate.
3. Right click the paulstretch project, and under Properties > Debugging, navigate to the appropriate foobar2000.exe file.

From there, building/running the project will place the .dll file in the components folder and run for debugging.
